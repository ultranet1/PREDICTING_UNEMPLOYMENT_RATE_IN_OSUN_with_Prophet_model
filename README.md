# PREDICTING_UNEMPLOYMENT_RATE_IN_OSUN_with_Prophet_model

This project is aimed at solving problems & getting insights indigenous to my country Nigeria.
I initially used a linear regression model,but now with more skills, I have choosen to use FbProphet model(Time_series_analysis)
   
Although, there is a challenge of a reliable central data in Nigeria, I was able to scrap data from opendataforafrica.org using pandas library.   
Also, I used python library like seaborn, matplotlib etc

The objective is to:
* Visualize these data  with EDA
* Check for relationship and correlation 
* Preprocess Data,to make it suitable for modelling
* Fit model to predict Unemployment rate(UER).

Data source=opendataforafrica.org
